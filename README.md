# Nougat
We design a robot to take a part in 'Zhongkong' robot competition in Zhejiang University. Our team is called Nougat    
We use Arduino Mega2560 to control robot and this is the code.     
Our robot can run in setted routine, collect target cubes and bring them home.     
posture.c reads data from a MPU9250 nine axis sensor and computes posture of the robot.    
motorSpeed controls speed of the motor.
